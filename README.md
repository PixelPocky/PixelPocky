- 👋 Hi, I’m @PixelPocky
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things, art, design, videogames (playing them and currently trying to make one), boardgames, music, animation.... Now if you ask me if I'm any good at those things.... let's just say that's a different toppic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding, and animation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games and programs.
